# My AI Web App Using Python and Flask
This is a web application with artificial intelligence (AI) that can translate text for the user. <br />
<br />
For the front end, I use Flask to integrate easily and seamlessly integrate services. Flask is described by its creators as a "micro-framework", meaning it provides the core services required, such as routing and templating, but otherwise allows developers/users to use whatever backend services their application needs. It's also lightweight, making it quick to set up and deploy, making a database unnecessary in this use case. I just need a framework to create my UI, and be able to call the back-end service. </br>

For the back end, rather than creating a machine learning model on my own, I use a collection of AI services (known as Azure Cognitive Service), and use the Translator service to meet our primary goal of translating text.
